Tor Configuration Examples

In this repository you can find configuration examples
for various types of Tor Nodes. These files are meant
to go to `/etc/tor/torrc` in most cases. 

I do not take any responsibility for problems / insecure
configurations found here, however I did my best to be as
careful as possible.
